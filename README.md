# My-WebApp-with-MySQL
HomeWork For Data-Manager.<br>
A Small Web App Using MySQL<br><br>


This is my Homework for the Data Manager.<br>
My Name is ZhangTao, My Student ID is 14211045.<br>
The LogIn page uses Html and CSS,(PS for the logo).And during the work, I stuied <br>
the <a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigitalOcean">Digital Ocean</a>`s logIn page. Including the CSS files and Html rules.<br>
The Digital Ocean's link is <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login">here</a> or click https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login<br>
BTW, the Digital Ocean's Droplets are really good.<br>


The page is very easy, and this is just a model, cannot do any real work.(Log In or sign up)<br>
You can test the page <a href="http://www.ynotme.me/login.html">here</a>  or click http://www.ynotme.me/login.html<br>

Just for Study  :)
