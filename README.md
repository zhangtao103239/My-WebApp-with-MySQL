# My-WebApp-with-MySQL
HomeWork For Data-Manager. A Small Web App Using MySQL


This is my Homework for the Data Manager.
My Name is ZhangTao, My Student ID is 14211045.
The LogIn page uses Html and CSS,(PS for the logo).And during the work, I learned 
the Digital Ocean`s logIn page. Including the CSS files and Html rules.
The Digital Ocean`s link is https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login
BTW, the Digital Ocean`s Droplets are really good.


The page is very easy, and this is just a model, cannot do any real work.(Log In or sign up)
You can test the page here

Just for Study.
